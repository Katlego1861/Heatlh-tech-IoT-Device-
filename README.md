# Heatlh-tech-IoT-Device-Project3-KL

Health IoT Device â€“ Pulse Wave Project
Overview

This repository contains the design, code, and documentation for a Health IoT device that monitors pulse and temperature, sends data to the cloud, and enables visualization through ThingSpeak and MIT App Inventor.

The project integrates hardware, IoT connectivity, and app development to create a portable health monitoring solution.
